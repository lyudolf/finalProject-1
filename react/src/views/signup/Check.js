              how long sentences = run-on sentences. You can have a six-word
              run-on sentence (“I went shopping I ate donuts.”), while most of
              the sentences below are much, much longer than that and are not
              run-ons (except for a few examples like Jose Saramago). But
              whether the sentence is grammatically correct isn’t nearly as
              important as whether the sentence is fun or beautiful. I hope that
              a study of very long sentences will arm you with strategies that
              are almost as diverse as the sentences themselves, such as:
              starting each clause with the same word, tilting with dependent
              clauses toward a revelation at the end, padding with
              parentheticals, showing great latitude toward standard
              punctuation, rabbit-trailing away from the initial subject,
              encapsulating an entire life, and lastly, as this sentence is,
              celebrating the list. What’s the definition of a long sentence?
              For my purposes, I’m defining it as more than a 100 words. I’ve
              cheated with a few beautiful sentences a few words short, because
              there is no sense in having an absolute and arbitrary rule, but
              more than 100 words was my guiding principle. I think any sentence
              more than 100 words is almost guaranteed to be complex,
              complicated, and enormous.
